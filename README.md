# leaflet-challenge
In this challenge I used different AI sources as well as bcs learning in order to get the correct syntax on different sections in my java script. 
I struggled with the html file some and creatingh the legend but apart from that it was pretty simple. The sample html that was provided really helped me make this one. I started to attempt part 2 but ran out of time so just revised part one to make it look a little better.
